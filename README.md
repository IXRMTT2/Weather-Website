# Weather-Website ‚õÖ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏èüå®Ô∏è

Doing this for java revision (trying to learn it basically off by heart by doing some of the basics).
I followed a tutorial for the first part but then added my own flare (TUTORIAL AT THE BOTTOM OF README).

# Tools / Languages
Used OpenWeather API, HTML, CSS, JS, Gify.

# Additions I made

- I added time
- I added, "view more details" sections (including the icons [found on giphy]).
- I added the gifs that appear to help show the weather better (gifs from gify)
- I changed the text to black to make it easier to read on certain pages
- I added that the gradient changes for each of the different types of weather (to help show what weather it is better).
